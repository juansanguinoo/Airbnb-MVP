          Ever stay in a giant seashell unicorn? No, you haven’t, but now you
          can cross it off your bucket list. This magical work of art is part
          Willy Wonka, part Big Lebowski, and totally unlike anywhere else. Do
          it for the ‘gram, but also for your soul. El espacio Come take a
          vacation from the real world of right angles and ticky tacky boxes.
          Situated on a secluded lot and wonderfully restored, The Bloomhouse is
          a celebration of all things magical and mystical. How the heck did
          this magnificent beast come to be? Like all the best things in Austin,
          it started with some hippies and a dream. See, back in the 70s, while
          Wooderson was wasting all his time away, two UT architecture students
          decided to build an escape from society that would become a monument
          to man and nature. Their goal was a home that would not only protect
          you from the elements but allow you to live in harmony with the
          environment. They wanted this quixotic vision to provide a place of
          peace and isolation, a place so far removed that for many years there
          was no physical address. Then the hippie dream disappeared into the
          1980’s Austin real estate boom, and there in the hills, the Bloomhouse
          waited. It would need just the right person who could see the home’s
          potential to bring this work of art back from the brink. And then the
          home’s fortunes shifted on a chance event. In 2017, Dave Claunch saw a
          real estate ad fall out of an Austin Business Journal for the
          Bloomhouse – a local legend he had learned about during his time as
          mayor. Claunch knew he had to save and preserve this one-of-a-kind
          place. Since buying the home, Claunch has spent over a year
          meticulously restoring the home with period-specific details to take
          it back to its original form. When you drive away from the shores of
          Lake Austin through West Lake Hills on your way to the Bloomhouse, you
          don’t know exactly where you’re headed, but you know it’s up. Up, up,
          up, and up the high road (Bloomhouse is literally located off of High
          Road). With unbelievable views of downtown Austin receding in your
          rearview, you find the side street where the house awaits in a wooded
          valley. Traveling along the road, you see her—the fantastical beast in
          the clearing—and you laugh out loud at the ridiculousness, the joy,
          the sheer courage of a house built to bend the rules of what’s
          possible.
